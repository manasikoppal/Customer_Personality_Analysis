# Customer_Personality_Analysis
Customer Personality Analysis examines a company's ideal customers to understand their needs, behaviors, and preferences. This helps businesses adapt products and tailor marketing strategies to specific customer segments.


Data Set:
The dataset contains customer information, including demographics, purchasing behavior, and engagement details. Each customer is uniquely identified by an ID, with demographic attributes such as year of birth, education level, marital status, and income. It also includes the number of children and teenagers living at home, alongside the date the customer joined the database. The dataset tracks recent activity through a "Recency" column, representing days since the last purchase. Purchasing behavior is detailed across various product categories, such as wine, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, and gold, measured by the amount spent. Additionally, it records the number of purchases made using deals or discounts. This data is ideal for customer segmentation, analyzing product preferences, and designing targeted marketing strategies.
